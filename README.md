# Data Science Project I
## Topic: Clustering Similar Areas in New York City and London
Description: The latitude and longitude values of cities in New York and London found on web were processed. 
Foursquare API was used to explore areas in New York City and London by their position information. 
Then, K-Mean Clustering Algorithm was applied to cluster areas both in New York and London together in order to find out the similar clusters in both cities.



# Data Science Project II
## Topic: Predicting Hang Seng Index with a bunch of other indices
Description: Stock Market is so mysterious that no one can predict its exact movement. In classical literature stated by economist Burton Malkiel that all the stocks markets are perfectly efficient that all the current prices already reflected all factors. The stock prices move in random motions. However, some may argue that there are some people earn a lot of money in the stock markets. This trigger a lot of researchers spend a lot of time and resources to investigate the movement of the stock markets.

In the old days, researchers may use regression and time series handling to predict the stock prices trend. The effectiveness of those methods are quite low. They are not reliable to use in the real time stock trading. Now, in this few years, machine learning algoirthms blossomed. A lot of effective and robust algorithms are implemented. Predicting the stock market prices seem to be a task that people would really interested in by applying the new algorithms.

In this project, a bunch of different indices were used to predict the movement of Hang Seng index. A window of 30 days previous data were used to predict the next day stock price. Neural Network model and RNN model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm were used.
